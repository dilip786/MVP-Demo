* Model: This handles the data part of our application
* Presenter: It acts as a bridge that connects a Model and a View.
* View: This is responsible for laying out views with the relevant data as instructed by the Presenter

### Android MVP Guidelines
* Activity, Fragment and a CustomView act as the View part of the application.
* The Presenter is responsible for listening to user interactions (on the View) and model updates (database, APIs) as well as   updating the Model and the View.
* Interfaces need to be defined and implemented to communicate between View-Presenter and Presenter-Model.
* The View and Model classes can’t have a reference of one another.

### Key Points

- The Presenter directly talking to Interface and the view implements the interface to get the information.
- The presenter doesn’t know which view it is taking to, it’s just transmit the data and view will receive data.
- View knows about which presenter is taking to.
